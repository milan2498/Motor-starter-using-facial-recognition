# Motor starter using facial recognition
 Python (raspberry-pi) based project that uses facial recognition to start a motor.
 
## Run dataset+trainer.py file that'll take a set of photos you want to recognize and train them.
## Then run facerecognition.py file to check the accuracy level.
## If you are using raspberry pi with a motor  then run motor.py file and set the accuracy level so that once the face is recognised the motor will run.
